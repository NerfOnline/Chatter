### Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Shuu and Tirem for allowing me to use XIUI to accomplish what I thought would not be possible. Thanks to Atom0s and Thorny for many of their addons were used as examples to accomplish various parts of the code. Thanks to Onimitch for their Balloon port (and of course thanks to the original author Hando with english support by Yuki and Kenshi as well as the themes added by Ghosty). Lastly thanks to Erupt for their RuptChat (aka rChat), which helped spark ideas and features for this addon.
